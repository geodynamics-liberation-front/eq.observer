# eq.Observer

## Project layout
As this project contains many parts this section will explain the structure of the file layout.  
One could, and many have, argued that a better approach would have been to create multiple
repositories for each "part" of the project.  Frankly that seemed to complicate things to much
for what is supposed to be a project accessible to students, teachers, and hobbyists.


```
python - the python code
device - the device contents
pi-image - Tools to build the eq.Observer image for the raspberry pi
```
